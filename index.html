        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>On my journey into Tech, I have completed a number of projects.</p>
        <p>Some of these I developed as part of my uni work, some of those I developed with others.</p>

              <br>
              <p>Permission Impossible is a game I created in the Unity Game Development Engine
                as part of my MSc Computer Science Dissertation Project. It's an interactive game that
                teaches beginners about Firewalls and network security in a friendly environment.
                It's written in C# and consists of multiple levels of varying difficulty.</p>

              <br>
              <p>As part of my Java Class, I designed and developed an application in which the player
              could move through an open world and pick up elements and move them to an inventory. In this project
              I made use of the JavaFX libraries for the Graphical User Interface and also learned how to
              design meaningful classes, with Model - View - Controller. It's written entirely in Java.</p>

              <br>
              <p>As part of the freeCodeCamp intermediate challenges, I build a
                <a href="https://alaskaa.github.io/fcc-weather-app/" target="_blank ">Local Weather App</a>.
                It takes the user's current location and returns the temperature and weather based on the
                user's location. You can also toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript
                to build it and made use of
                <a href="https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/" target="_blank ">Erik Flowers CSS Weather Icons</a>.

                during the 12 hour Game Jam - <emph>Jam Sandwich</emph>, hosted by GameDevSoc
                Edinburgh. The focus was on creating a complete game in those 12 hours which posed a challenge for us both
                due to our limited experience with game development. It's built entirely in Unity. Just use the arrow keys and
                spacebar to navigate.

              <br>
              <p>Battleships is a terminal application that <a href="https://github.com/questionmarcus" target="_blank ">Marcus Lancaster</a>
                and I built entirely in Python. It is based on the famous game Battleships but played
                entirely on the terminal. The player plays against the computer and can choose to place
                his own ships, or get a random board. The game ends, when one of the players hits all ships.

              <p>As part of my Dynamic Web Design Class, two colleagues and I built a dynamic Website
              in HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL. This page allowed artists to create profiles and be found
              by people interested in having them play at their gig. It also contains a messaging system.
              I was responsible for the front-end development of the application, but also helped out
              with design and backend development.

              <p>During my Human-Computer Interaction class, I worked on creating a usable website

              and accessible. In order to determine whether it achieved its objective, I ran user
              testing such as Think-Alouds and Interviews.</p>

              <p>
              As part of the Code First: Girls Python course, I wrote several python scripts that would work
              with the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and use the camera module of my Raspberry Pi.
              The scripts could be altered to tweet pictures in regular intervals to send party pictures or
              as a monitoring system.

          <p>Roughly four years ago during my undergraduate in Economics, I first touched code when I decided it would
          be useful to learn Java for Android Development. Following that, I have self-taught myself basic web development
          skills and some JavaScript. Through my determination and continuous efforts in programming I was accepted into
          the Computer Science Masters Programme at the University of Edinburgh, which gave me the opportunity to increase
          my programming abilities and learn about Software Design, Architecture, Management and also Computer Networking
          and Security. I also taught myself Python during the course of this degree which I now also use for data analysis.
